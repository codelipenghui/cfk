# Console for Kafka (cfk) Product Design Document

## 1. Executive Summary
Console for Kafka (cfk) is a modern, user-friendly terminal-based management console designed to simplify Apache Kafka operations. Inspired by tools like k9s, cfk provides developers, DevOps, and data engineers with an interactive command-line interface for monitoring, managing, and troubleshooting Kafka clusters, topics, consumers, and messages, reducing operational complexity and increasing productivity.

## 2. Product Overview
cfk offers an interactive terminal dashboard for Kafka cluster management, real-time monitoring, topic and consumer group administration, message inspection, and troubleshooting. The product is designed for both on-premises and cloud-based Kafka deployments, supporting secure multi-cluster management and role-based access control, all within a terminal UI.

## 3. Market Analysis
- **Market Trends:** Increasing adoption of event-driven architectures and streaming data platforms has made Kafka a critical infrastructure component. There is a growing demand for tools that simplify Kafka management and monitoring.
- **Potential Demand:** Organizations using Kafka often struggle with its operational complexity. Existing open-source and commercial tools have gaps in usability, real-time insights, and troubleshooting capabilities.
- **Competitors:** Confluent Control Center, AKHQ, Kafdrop, Kafka Tool, and proprietary dashboards from cloud providers.

## 4. User Personas
- **DevOps Engineer:** Needs to monitor Kafka health, manage clusters, and troubleshoot issues quickly.
- **Data Engineer:** Wants to inspect topics, manage schemas, and debug message flows.
- **Developer:** Needs to test message publishing/consumption and view topic data.
- **SRE/Administrator:** Requires audit logs, access control, and cluster configuration management.

## 5. Feature Set
### Core Features
- **Terminal UI:**
  - Interactive, keyboard-driven navigation (inspired by k9s)
  - Customizable key bindings and themes
  - Real-time updates and dynamic views in the terminal
- **Cluster Management:**
  - Add, remove, and configure Kafka clusters
  - View cluster health and broker status
- **Topic Management:**
  - List, create, delete, and configure topics
  - View topic details (partitions, replication, configs)
  - Topic data browsing and search
- **Consumer Group Management:**
  - List consumer groups and members
  - View lag and offsets
  - Reset offsets
- **Message Inspection:**
  - Browse, search, and filter messages
  - Produce and consume messages via terminal UI
- **Monitoring & Alerts:**
  - Real-time metrics (throughput, latency, lag)
  - Customizable alerts and notifications in-terminal
- **Security & Access Control:**
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Audit logs
  - Integration with LDAP/OAuth
- **Troubleshooting Tools:**
  - Error logs and event tracing
  - Partition reassignment and balancing
- **Multi-Cluster Support:**
  - Manage multiple Kafka clusters from a single terminal interface

### Optional/Advanced Features
- Schema Registry integration
- Connectors management (Kafka Connect)
- Integration with monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Dark mode and UI customization

## 6. Technical Requirements
- **Terminal UI Framework:** TUI libraries (e.g., Bubble Tea for Go, tview for Go, or similar for Rust/Python)
- **Backend:** CLI application (Go/Rust/Python/Java)
- **Kafka Client:** Support for latest Kafka APIs
- **Authentication:** OAuth2, LDAP, or SSO integration
- **Deployment:** Single binary, Docker/Kubernetes support
- **Database:** For storing user settings, audit logs (SQLite/PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- **Scalability:** Support for large clusters and high message volumes
- **Security:** Encrypted connections (TLS), secure credential storage

## 7. Development Roadmap
1. **MVP (Milestone 1):**
   - Cluster, topic, and consumer group management
   - Basic message browsing and production
   - Basic authentication
2. **Milestone 2:**
   - Monitoring dashboard and real-time metrics
   - Alerts and notifications
   - Advanced message search/filter
3. **Milestone 3:**
   - RBAC, audit logs, and security features
   - Multi-cluster support
   - Troubleshooting tools
4. **Milestone 4:**
   - Schema registry and connectors integration
   - UI/UX enhancements
   - Third-party integrations

## 8. Success Metrics
- User adoption rate (number of active users/organizations)
- Reduction in Kafka-related incidents and troubleshooting time
- User satisfaction (NPS, feedback surveys)
- Performance (latency, throughput of UI/API)
- Feature usage analytics
